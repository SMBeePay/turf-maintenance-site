```

**Test key pages manually:**

   - Use "HTML meta tag" method
   - The verification tag is already in your Analytics component ‚úÖ
4. **Submit Sitemap**: 
   - Go to "Sitemaps" in left menu

2. `https://your-site.com/services`
3. `https://your-site.com/gmax-testing-dallas`
4. `https://your-site.com/locations/dallas-artificial-turf-maintenance`

## üö® Troubleshooting

**If deployment fails:**
- Make sure you're in the project directory
- Check that `npm run build` works locally
- Try `vercel` without `--prod` first (deploys to preview)

**If analytics don't work:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify GA4 measurement ID: `G-PYKPC1JTFZ`
- Wait 5-10 minutes for data to appear

**If pages don't load:**
